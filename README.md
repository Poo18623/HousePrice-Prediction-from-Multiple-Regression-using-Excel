House Price Prediction from Multiple Regression using Excel

The dataset (in Excel format) is attached.  The variables are described below.
Description of Variables:

Variable	         Description of Variables
Price	        Price of the house in Dollars
Living Area	  Living Area in Sq. Ft.
Bathrooms	    Number of Bathrooms (There is a concept of “half-bathroom”)
Bedrooms	    Number of Bedrooms
Lot Size	    Size of the Plot (in acres)
Age	          Age of the house (in months)
Fireplace	    Is there a fireplace in the house? – Yes or No
Locality	    City Zone (there are three zones – A, B and C)

The objective is to build an appropriate regression model for predicting the price of the house.  You are free to generate more variables, if necessary, based on the data given.  For example, you may decide that the average room size may be important in determining the price and consequently, create a new variable by dividing the Living Area with Number of Bedrooms or average number of bathrooms per bedroom.
1.	Build an appropriate regression model for predicting the price of the house
2.	Interpret the results of the final regression equation (including ANOVA, R2, intercept and coefficients, significance levels, MSE, Standard Error, Adjusted R2 etc.)
3.	Test each of the assumptions involved with regression using appropriate tests
4.	Carry out the diagnostics required
5.	Predict the price of a house which has 3000 sq. ft. Living area, with a fireplace, 4 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms with a Lot Size of 1.5 acres.
6.	Build a 95% confidence interval for the predicted price.
